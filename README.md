# BeatSaberPlaylistMaster
**This app creates and edit playlist files (json and bplist) that can be read by [rithik-b's Playlist Manager](https://github.com/rithik-b/PlaylistManager), without this mod you won't see any of the created playlists in game**

## Features 
- Create and delete new playlists.
- Edit the list of songs inside the playlist, with time saving tools like adding all unplaylisted songs or adding all search results.
- Edit the image and description of a playlist.
- Download missing songs from existing playlists (for example, when you receive a playlist file from a friend, or download one from [Bsaber.com](https://bsaber.com/))

## To be added
### Soon
- Code cleanup and fix known bugs.

### Later
- Add search in BeatSaver and download from BeatSaver functionality, as well as filter by rating, downloads and latest.
- Rewrite most of the base code using [Zingabopp's BeatSaberPlaylistsLib](https://github.com/Zingabopp/BeatSaberPlaylistsLib) to work better with PlaylistManager

## Download
To download and install simply go to the repository's [release page](https://github.com/Zoobumafu/BeatSaberUltimatePlaylistEditor/releases) and download the latest version from there (currently 1.1.0).

## Known Issues
- Currently, if you have 2 or more songs with the exact same name, the application will only be able to interact with one of them.

## Issues and Support
If you encounter any issue, please create an issue on Github, or PM me on discord Zubumafu#2107, I will attempt to fix it as soon as I can.
If possible, please add the playlist / song file that cause the issue into the ticket / message.
